# Cumulocity Integration Microservice for Disruptive Technologies

## Description
This is a Microservice that allows Receiving, Mapping and Transport of [Disruptive Technologies](https://www.disruptive-technologies.com/) Device Messages to Cumulocity.
The integration is a cloud-to-cloud integration with a Server Side Agent running within Cumulocity as a Microservice.
The "Data Connectors" of Disruptive Technologies (DT) are used to forward data via REST to the endpoint provided by the Microservice.

## Microservice Configuration
Make sure you enter your the following Properties in the `application.properties` file:
- `C8Y.baseURL` - URL to your Tenant and Cumulocity Instance
- `dt.secret` - Your Connector Secret. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Build
Make sure that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) are installed and running on your Computer.
Run `mvn clean package` to build the Microservice which will create a ZIP archive you can upload to Cumulocity.

## Deploy
1. Login to your Cumulocity Tenant. Go to Administration -> Applications. Click on "Add Application" and "Upload Microservice".
2. Select the zip archive generated by the [Build](#build).
    > NOTE: Rename the zip archive to "dt-integration.zip" before uploading it
3. Wait until the Microservice is uploaded and started. You can check that under the application and Status.

## Devices in Cumulocity
The Devices will be created by using the label `name` of the Disruptive Tech.
All Data incoming will be created as Event on the Device with the Name `
DT Logging Device`.

Dependant on the type of the Device it will have Events "Object opened" and "Object closed" or Measurements like Temperature etc.
All of them have Measurements `Battery`,  `Daily Counter` and `Signal Strength`.
The Daily Counter counts the received "Object opened/closed" Events per Day.

You can use them to create your own Dashboards, Smart Rules, Apama Rules.
